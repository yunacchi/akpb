Gib Eyja or Saria or Lappland plz.

## Getting started on development

This is an [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) project.

You need at least [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and preferably an Angular-aware code editor (like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with extensions) to make your life easier.

To watch:

```bash
cd angular
npm install
npm start
```
